**Safety follow-ups from a second review.** Each closes a way a game could go wrong silently; see [MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/typeonce-dev/ritmo/blob/main/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-to-090).

- **A `SpawnedId` is valid only in the run that spawned it.** Kept in a closure or resource and passed to `commands.despawn` / `commands.remove` in a later run, it could name an entity despawned meanwhile whose id was reused. Such a command is now skipped, traced as a `staleTarget` effect, and reported by the new `stale-target` lint (`Debug.StaleTarget`). Keep the entity id or a handle and resolve it through a query.
- **`any` and `never` are not descriptor values.** `Descriptor.Component<any>()`, `Resource`, `Event`, `Service`, and the transient variants fail at the constructor: `any` turned off every check on the descriptor, and `never` erased the fragment listing it.
- **A saved component cannot require a transient one.** `Schema.bind` rejects `Schema.requires(Ghost, Trail)` when only `Trail` is transient: a restore brought `Ghost` back without it. A transient requirer may still require a transient component.
- **Queries with `added` / `changed` filters have no lookups.** `get`, `getHandle`, `single`, `children`, and `descendants` failed with `QueryMismatch` whenever the target had not changed since the system's previous run; they no longer compile there. Declare a second query without filters to resolve entities. `each()` and `singleOptional()` are unchanged. The handle types are now `QueryIteration` and `QueryLookups` (`QueryHandle` combines them).
- **A transition's exit phase is one transaction.** When a system in `onExit` / `onTransition` fails, everything the phase did (component writes, resources, events, queued next states and commands, stream positions) is undone and the transition stays queued, so the retry starts from the same state instead of running the earlier exit systems twice. These schedules can no longer contain `applyDeferred()`.
- **A service or machine provided twice does not compile.** `Runtime.services` / `Runtime.machines` kept the last of two provisions; the second now fails, naming it.
- **`RenderSync` recovers from dropped removals.** After a pause longer than a stream keeps entries, the removals it missed left nodes on screen; when its removal stream reports `lagged()`, it now destroys every node whose entity no longer matches. Give each `RenderSync.system` its own registry.
- **New lint `stream-loss-unread`.** On a debug runtime, a reader of events, transition events, removed, despawned, or relation failures that lost entries without checking `lagged()` is a warning, and one reading under `pauseWhen` without checking it is noted (`Debug.StreamLoss`).
